LaneKeeping Project
Internet computing Lab
========================

This is an application writing for controlling drone from Linux companion computer

Building
========
Import project to Netbeans(Intalled OpenCV) and build

Hardware Setup
=========
An onboard subsystem composed by:

    - High-level Linux Vision controller uses a companion computer which can run multi

    threads, broadcast wireless signal as an access point

    - Low-level Flight controller will handle attitude and position controllers in a open-

    stack platform

    - Camera

    - Communication interface with flight control and ground control system
A ground control station system:

    - Ground computer with interface to control the onboard subsystem

    - Communication interface

    - Remote controller
